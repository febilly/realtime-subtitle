"""Speculative decoding over the ctypes llama.cpp binding, shared by local ASR and local translation.

Both streaming paths re-run the same model over an input that grew a little: the audio buffer gained a
second, or the source sentence gained a few characters. The previous output is therefore a strong
prediction of the next one. Submitting it alongside the freshly sampled token lets a single forward pass
commit every token the model agrees with, instead of one token per pass.

Verification is exact — each drafted position is sampled normally and kept only if it matches — so
*which* tokens come out never changes, only how many forward passes it takes to produce them.

Measured on this repo's models (RTX 3080, Vulkan): 2.3x on the Qwen3-ASR token loop across the partials
of one utterance, and 1.1x-2.3x on Hy-MT2 depending on utterance length. The win grows with length,
because a long line is re-emitted almost unchanged on every update.

Nothing here touches the vendored glue in ``vendor/qwen_asr_gguf``; ``llama_memory_seq_rm`` is bound
locally because that module does not expose it (it is stable llama.cpp API, present in the shipped DLL).
